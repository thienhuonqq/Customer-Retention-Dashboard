Task 2 of the virtual case experience program by PwC Switzerland, offered through Forage. 

The Retention Managers can benefit from a dashboard that reflects key performance indicators (KPIs) related to the current churning and retention situation. The objective of the dashboard is to provide managers with a clear understanding of which customers are at risk of churning, allowing them to proactively develop action plans aimed at solving the root cause of why customers were leaving the business. This tool can help to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Retention Manager's efforts to retain customers and reduce churn. 


To find the root cause of churn, we need to analyze the various factors that contribute to customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Based on the metrics provided, we can identify the following potential root causes of churn: 

- Service-related issues: Customers may churn due to issues with their internet or phone services. In this case, the high number of Tech tickets for churned customers and the high churn rate for Phone Services suggest that there may be problems with service quality or customer support that need to be addressed.

- Payment-related issues: Customers may churn due to issues with payment methods or billing. The high churn rate for customers using electronic check and mailed check payment methods, as well as the high churn rate for Paperless Billing Method, suggest that there may be issues with payment processing or billing accuracy.

- Contract-related issues: Customers may churn due to issues related to contract terms or duration. The high churn rate for customers with month-to-month contracts suggests that customers may be leaving due to dissatisfaction with service quality or price.

Based on the potential root causes of churn identified, here are some strategies the Retention Manager can implement to address the issues and reduce churn:

- Increase tech support capacity: To address service-related issues, the company can invest in improving service quality and customer support. The company can invest in hiring additional support staff or outsourcing tech support services to increase capacity and improve response times for Fiber Optic customers. Additionally, the company can provide training for customer support representatives to address customer issues effectively and efficiently, thereby reducing the number of tech tickets per customer. The Retention Manager can also launch a marketing campaign to promote the improved tech support capacity and encourage Fiber Optic customers to use it.

- Increase yearly automatic payments: The company can provide incentives such as discounts or rewards to customers who sign up for automatic payments. The Retention Manager can also provide educational resources to help customers understand the benefits of automatic payments, such as avoiding late fees and improving credit scores. Additionally, the company can make the process of signing up for automatic payments as easy as possible by providing clear instructions and offering support to customers who need help.

- Increase sale of 1 and 2 year contracts: To address contract-related issues, the company can offer more flexible contract terms and pricing options. This can include providing longer-term contracts at lower rates, offering bundle packages with internet and phone services, and providing promotional discounts to retain month-to-month customers and encourage them to renew their contracts.
